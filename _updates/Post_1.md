We reached out to Metrolinx to understand when the decision was made to remove the pedestrian crossing at Lappin Avenue and Antler Avenue from the project. Stefany Sadnyk from Community Engagement claimed that “this fact has been clearly articulated in plans for the Greenway project dating back several years.”

We’ve shared the news with many Junction Triangle and Wallace-Emerson residents who were surprised to learn this news, which means that the removal of the crossing may have been included in updated construction drawings, but Metrolinx did not clearly communicate these plans to the community. In fact, members of Options for Davenport, the original group to advocate for community benefits from the Davenport Diamond project, only learned that the pedestrian crossing was removed a few months ago at one of the first virtual open houses about the Davenport Greenway project.

It’s clear that Metrolinx made this decision during the pandemic (the earliest evidence of the removal of the pedestrian crossing is seen in consultation materials in 2020 where there is a star showing an access from Antler Street but not from Lappin Avenue), and well after meaningful engagement with the community ended in 2017/2018.
