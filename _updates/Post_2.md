# Metrolinx and the City of Toronto’s trust in private business to invest in the community

Metrolinx and Councillor Bailao’s office both described the future greenway under the Barrie GO rail bridge as a “catalyst for economic and social change.”

How can a fenced off multi-use trail be a catalyst for anything if no one can access it?

At one point, Metrolinx proposed a market and public square at Wallace Avenue, across from Halo Brewery and Neon Cafe. Now that area is blocked by a large metal fence.

Metrolinx and Councillor Bailao’s office provided the example of Henderson Brewery creating a connection to the West Toronto Rail Path. They have their fingers crossed that businesses along the Davenport Greenway will do the same thing, which will mean that the City of Toronto and Metrolinx can sit back and allow private business to invest in the public realm.

The problem is that the businesses along the Davenport Greenway are not retail businesses. They will not benefit from increased foot traffic from the Greenway. The City of Toronto and Metrolinx are naive in believing that “if they build it they will come.” In this case, both the City and Metrolinx need to put a little more effort into this project if they truly want it to be a catalyst for any type of community change or growth.
