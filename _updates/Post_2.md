# Metrolinx’s trust in private business to invest in the community

Metrolinx described the future greenway under the Barrie GO rail bridge as a “catalyst for economic and social change.”

How can a fenced off multi-use trail be a catalyst for anything if no one can access it?

At one point, Metrolinx proposed a market and public square at Wallace Avenue, across from Halo Brewery and Neon Cafe. Now that area is blocked by a large metal fence.

Metrolinx stakeholder relation's office provided the example of Henderson Brewery creating a connection to the West Toronto Rail Path. They have their fingers crossed that businesses along the Davenport Greenway will do the same thing, which will mean that Metrolinx can sit back and allow private business to invest in the public realm.

The problem is that the businesses along the Davenport Greenway are not retail businesses. They will not benefit from increased foot traffic from the Greenway. Metrolinx are naive in believing that “if they build it they will come.” In this case, Metrolinx needs to put a little more effort into this project if they truly want it to be a catalyst for any type of community change or growth.
