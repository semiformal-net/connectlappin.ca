MPP Marit Stiles sent this comment regarding the Antler-Lappin connection:

> When Metrolinx came to the community in 2018, they presented
residents with the idea of building a connection between Antler St and
Lappin Ave to connect residents to Campbell Park, the new Davenport
Guideway pedestrian path, schools, and a new public library. Under the
Ford government, this proposal for a community connection was
removed, leaving residents without access to the community benefits
being constructed around them.
Residents have been navigating dangerous detours and hearing
construction noise almost 24 hours a day, all the while knowing that
they will not stand to benefit. My office has worked with the
community in demanding that Metrolinx recommit to building the
connection at Antler St and Lappin Ave. Building public transit is not
only a means to connect people from point A to point B – it is an
opportunity to create new connections and bring communities
together. I will continue to bring attention to this issue, working with
the Councillor’s office and residents to see this project is completed as
promised.
