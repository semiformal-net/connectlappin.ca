City Councillor Alejandra Bravo shared the following update on the Antler-Lappin connection:

>Our community wants to be connected, and wants to see Metrolinx's Davenport Diamond
Guideway/Greenway project live up to expectations. I share that vision for building our
public realm and have been working over the past several months to advance the
investigation of a pedestrian and cycling connection between Antler Street & Lappin
Avenue.
>
>While Metrolinx previously included the connection in original plans for the Greenway, I
have learned from Metrolinx staff that a change in government in 2018 led to changes in
Metrolinx's mandate and policy, which led to the abrupt removal of the connection from
all public documents at that time. This does not take away the need for this connection,
which the community has been expecting.
>
>In June 2023, Toronto City Council adopted [my motion](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2023.MM7.14) which endorses, in principle, the
creation of an east-west connection between Antler Street and Lappin Avenue. The
motion also directs City staff to explore the use of municipal tools, potential partnerships
with the Province of Ontario and Metrolinx, and any other opportunities which would help
to establish this connection.
>
>Since then, I've met with Metrolinx, City staff, and our MPP Marit Stiles to discuss options
for creating a connection. City staff have identified preliminary options through which the
City may be able to create the connection:
>
>1. Expropriation
It may be possible to expropriate a strip of land for a pathway at the north end of the 90
Ward Street property limit and/or at the south end of the 800 Lansdowne Avenue
property limit. A zoning by-law amendment could be required.
The costs of expropriation and the easement are estimated to be close to $2 million. The
expropriation process requires 15-18 months, while an amicable negotiation process
would require 4-6 months.
>2. Future Redevelopment
Should either property (90 Ward St or 800 Lansdowne Ave) be redeveloped, this
connection could be eligible under community benefits or site access under Section 37.
However, there is no indication as to whether a development application is being
considered for either property.
