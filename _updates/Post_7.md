When Metrolinx completed the new, elevated platform for the Barrie GO line, they could have created a path underneath connecting Lappin and Antler. Instead, thereâ€™s a fence blocking the way. This is no good!

<b>We want the City of Toronto to create a walking path under the elevated GO line between Antler and Lappin.</b>
