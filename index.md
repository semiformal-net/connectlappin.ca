# Join us!

We want to keep the pressure on and show Councilor Bravo, Metrolinx, and the property owner on the east side of Lappin just how much our community wants to see this path happen.

Join us on **Sunday, Oct. 1 from 1-3 p.m.** in the northeast corner of Campbell Park for a pizza and banner-making party. There will be pizza from Defina and Cafe Neon and treats from Hale. Speeches will start at 1:20 p.m.

The event is a great chance to meet neighbours and get a more detailed status update on the project. Please mark your calendars and invite your friends and family. Kids are welcome too!
