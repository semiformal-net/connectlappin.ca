# Connect Lappin

A community site to advocate for a pedestrian link between Lappin Avenue and Antler Street under the currently under construction GO Rail bridge ([Davenport Diamond Guideway](http://www.metrolinx.com/en/greaterregion/projects/davenport-diamond.aspx)). This connection will bring together the neighbourhoods of Wallace-Emerson and the Junction Triangle, making it easier for residents to access:

- Perth Avenue Junior School and St Luigi Catholic School
- Campbell Park
- The future Perth/Dupont Library
- Wallace-Emerson Recreation Centre
