City councillor Alejandra Bravo [issued a statement May 26, 2023](https://www.alejandrabravo.ca/statement_antlerlappin) affirming her support for the Antler-Lappin connection.

> At the next meeting of Toronto City Council, I will be moving a motion to affirm support for a connection between Antler Street and Lappin Avenue, renew dialogue between the City of Toronto and Metrolinx on this issue, and examine all tools at the Cityâ€™s disposal to move this project forward.
