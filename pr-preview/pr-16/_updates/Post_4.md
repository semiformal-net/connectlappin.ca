There have been many developments with the path and we’re keen to get you up to speed — and have you join us to show your support for the path at a community pizza party on Sunday, Oct. 1 at 1 p.m. in Campbell Park.

## The path update:

In mid-June, in response to our petition, Councillor Alejandra Bravo brought forward two motions to City Council related to the Lappin-Antler path — and [both passed](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2023.MM7.14)!

In the first motion, councillors endorsed in principle the creation of the walking and cycling path, connecting Antler St. and Lappin Ave. In the second motion, council recommended city staff explore all available options to get it done.

We were very encouraged by this progress, but since June, emails from Councilor Bravo’s office have been discouraging. At a meeting earlier this summer, city staff estimated the cost of implementing the path at upwards of $2 million — an absurd figure.

Councilor Bravo continues to support the project and her office said they have another meeting with city staff this month. We’re hopeful for a more favourable report back. In the meantime…

## The pizza party: Join us on Oct. 1

We want to keep the pressure on and show Councilor Bravo, Metrolinx, and the property owner on the east side of Lappin just how much our community wants to see this path happen.

Join us on Sunday, Oct. 1 from 1-3 p.m. in the northeast corner of Campbell Park for a pizza and banner-making party. There will be pizza from Defina and Cafe Neon and treats from Hale. Speeches will start at 1:20 p.m.

The event is a great chance to meet neighbours and get a more detailed status update on the project. Please mark your calendars and invite your friends and family. Kids are welcome too!

## Some politicians and journalists plan to join us, so it’s crucial our numbers are strong!

If you’d like to be involved in the day-of set-up or have a local business and would like a poster to promote the event, please email us via info@connectlappin.ca.

See you soon!
